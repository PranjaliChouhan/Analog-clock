# Analog-clock

Analog Clock is a simple and elegant clock built using React, leveraging the power of `useEffect`, `useState`, and `styled-components`. 
It displays the current time in a classic analog format, with smoothly moving hour, minute, and second hands.



### Installation



1. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Additionally, install `styled-components` if not already installed.

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

### Usage

Run the application locally in development mode.

```bash
npm start
```


### How it Works

The Analog Clock is created using React functional components and hooks. The `useEffect` hook is responsible for updating the clock hands every second to display the accurate time. Meanwhile, the `useState` hook handles the state of the clock hands, allowing smooth animations.
